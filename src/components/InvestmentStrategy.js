          Most of my investments, are in technology related businesses as I
          believe they have the best long term growth potential. However I also
          invest in companies in other industries if I think they have good
          growth potential and good management to diversify the portfolio so
          we're not dangerously exposed to the tech sector.

          I only invest in stocks and{" "}
          <StyledTooltip data-tip="Exchange Traded Funds">ETFs</StyledTooltip>{" "}
          on eToro and very rarely
          <StyledTooltip data-tip="A type of investment where you make money if the stock falls and lose money if it rises">
            {" "}
            short{" "}

          anything. Long term stock prices tend to go up and by shorting an
          asset you can only gain 100% if the value drops to zero but you can
          lose an unlimited amount of money if the share price continues to
          rise. The only time I may short certain assets is during an extremely
          bearish market to reduce the volatility of the portfolio which eToro 
          uses to calculate the risk score.
          <br />
          <br />I invest in well run businesses and use fundamentals to value a
          company. These fundamentals include looking at financial ratios as
          well as the company revenue, customer growth rates and assets/
          liabilities and other variables. I aim to invest for
          periods of at least 3 years as investing over a longer period avoids
          being subject to unpredictable short term fluctuations in the market.
